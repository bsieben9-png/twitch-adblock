This is a **beta**. It is not the stable download. v0.2.3 stays Latest.

The gecko on the toolbar is the same. While general blocking is on, its eyes glow. That glow is only a quiet “this is on” mark. It does not mean every ad is gone.

## Picture guide (beta features)

## What this beta adds

On ordinary websites:

- Many known ad servers are blocked, using a packed list (trimmed EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe’s list, and a malware-host list). Credit: The EasyList authors.
- Leftover ad boxes are hidden when the page can spare them. Some empty spots and some ads can still show. This does not block every ad.
- General blocking starts **on**.
- The popup has a master on/off switch. It does not turn Twitch or YouTube ad handling off.
- **Allow this page** lets the open ordinary site through.
- **Update lists** is on the popup. In this beta it only remembers that you asked. It does not download a new list yet. The lists in the zip are the ones that run. Nothing fetches on its own in the background.

Twitch, YouTube (including Music, Kids, and embeds), and Kick are left out of that general list, including the video addresses those players use. Twitch and YouTube playback scripts match the stable build and were not edited for general blocking.

This zip also includes the Kick in-player ad try from beta v0.2.4 / PR #12: when Kick’s IVS player can jump back to the live stream, short ad breaks are skipped without muting or hiding the video. The general list still does not run on kick.com.

Debug still starts off. Copy debug still works on Twitch and YouTube.

Chrome may warn that this can block content on pages. Hiding leftover boxes also runs on ordinary sites, so Chrome may say it can change those pages. It does not run that hide on Twitch, YouTube, or Kick. The About text on the project is still Bran’s to rewrite. These notes do not replace that.

## What it should be able to do later

- Pressing **Update lists** should bring in a fresh list, still only when you ask.
- Kick skip can get better without ever letting the general list touch Kick.
- Leftover-box hiding can get better. It still will not be a promise that every ad is gone.
- The safety sentences on the main page can be rewritten once Bran picks the words.

## Install

Keep scrolling for the zip under **Assets**. Download `twitch-adblock-0.2.5.zip`. Unzip it and load that folder in Chrome the same way as the stable build. You do not need the long picture guide again.

Do not replace your stable v0.2.3 folder if you want the main download unchanged. This beta is a separate folder.
