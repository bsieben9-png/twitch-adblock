A free Chrome extension for Twitch live streams and YouTube. It runs only in your browser and does not send data anywhere.

## What it does

- **Twitch live:** during a commercial break, it switches to a clean copy of the same stream, then switches back when the break ends. If a clean copy is not available, the ad may play so your video does not freeze.
- **YouTube:** removes player ads and Sponsored cards on the Home page.
- **Other sites:** many ad servers are blocked, and leftover ad boxes are hidden. This does not block every ad. Twitch and YouTube are left alone.
- VODs and clips are left alone.

Placeholder: Bran will rewrite the safety lines. The stable download stays v0.2.3. This branch is beta 0.2.5.

## Is this safe?

It only runs inside Chrome on Twitch and YouTube.

<img src="docs/cards-main/safe/03-no-data.png" width="800" alt="No data collection. No account. Nothing is collected or sent off your computer.">

- **Only Twitch and YouTube** — does not open or run other webpages, and does not install programs on your PC.
- **No data collection** — no account, nothing collected, nothing sent off your computer.

## Current build

<img src="docs/cards-main/whats-new.png" width="800" alt="Current stable build v0.2.3. Gecko toolbar icon. Twitch live swaps to a clean stream during ads. YouTube clears player ads and home Sponsored cards.">

The toolbar icon is a gecko head. Twitch and YouTube work as described above.

Debug starts **off**. You only need it if something goes wrong (see step 6 below).

Full notes: [v0.2.3 release](https://github.com/gecko-of-shadow/twitch-adblock/releases/tag/v0.2.3).

## Install (for first-time Chrome installs)

You do **not** need a GitHub account. You are only downloading a zip and loading it in Chrome like a local app.

### 1. Open the release page

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/01-open-github.png" width="800" alt="Step 1: Open the GitHub release page.">

Or skip ahead and use the download button in step 2.

### 2. Download the zip

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/02-download-zip.png" width="800" alt="Step 2: Open Releases to download the zip.">

Open **[Releases](https://github.com/gecko-of-shadow/twitch-adblock/releases/latest)** and download the zip under **Assets** — or use this direct link:

**[Download twitch-adblock-0.2.3.zip](https://github.com/gecko-of-shadow/twitch-adblock/releases/download/v0.2.3/twitch-adblock-0.2.3.zip)**

### 3. Unzip the folder

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/03-unzip.png" width="800" alt="Step 3: Unzip the download and keep the folder.">

- Windows: right-click the zip → **Extract All…**
- Mac: double-click the zip

Keep the folder that appears. Do not delete it after install — Chrome reads the extension from that folder.

### 4. Open Chrome Extensions

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/04-extensions.png" width="800" alt="Step 4: Open chrome://extensions and turn on Developer mode.">

1. Open a new tab and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)

### 5. Load unpacked

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/05-load-unpacked.png" width="800" alt="Step 5: Click Load unpacked and pick the folder with manifest.json.">

1. Click **Load unpacked**
2. Choose the unzipped folder (the one that contains `manifest.json`)
3. You should see twitch-adblock in the list, with the gecko icon

Turn off other Twitch or YouTube ad blockers while this is loaded. Two ad blockers on the same page can freeze the video.

### 6. Debug (optional)

<img src="docs/cards-main/install/06-debug.png" width="800" alt="Step 6: Debug starts off. Turn it on only if you need a log.">

**[Open Releases to download →](https://github.com/gecko-of-shadow/twitch-adblock/releases/latest)**

Debug starts **OFF**. Leave it off for normal watching.

If something looks wrong:

1. Click the gecko icon in Chrome to open the popup
2. Turn **Debug** ON
3. Click **Copy debug**
4. Paste that text into a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gecko-of-shadow/twitch-adblock/issues)

The log stays on your computer until you copy it. Nothing is sent automatically. Turn Debug **OFF** again when you are done.

## Notes

- Picture quality can dip briefly during a Twitch ad break. Playback should keep going.
- Ads already baked into a YouTube video file still play.
- Development: `deno test --no-lock test/` · `bash scripts/release-gate.sh` · `bash scripts/pack-zip.sh`
